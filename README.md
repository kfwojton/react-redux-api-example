List of launches from the api at https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launchesâ€‹  on the basis of React + Redux

See the unfinished work-in-progress live app --> https://react-launches-app.herokuapp.com/
## Quick Start

To run this app locally just clone, run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Optimized Build

`npm run build`
